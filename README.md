# Binary Search Tree Implementation

This project is a minimalist, recursive implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in JavaScript. It's designed to follow the core specifications of The Odin Project, with a strong emphasis on functional programming, clean architecture, and learning-by-doing.

### ðŸš€ Features
- Build balanced trees from sorted arrays
- Insert and delete nodes while maintaining BST rules
- Multiple traversal methods: in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order
- Depth, height, and balance checks
- Auto-rebalancing after insertions
- Pretty-print tree structure in the console

### ðŸ§ª Testing
You can write and run custom tests in the `test.js` file:

```bash
node test.js
```

Use this to interact with the tree, verify outputs, and visualize structure changes via prettyPrint().
